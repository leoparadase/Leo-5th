CHAPTER ONE



Boom!



Josh was in bed. Suddenly... BOOM! His pictures blew off the walls. The door blew open. There were bits of window on his bed and on the floor. And there was dust - lots and lots of it.



'I can't see! Mum! Gran!' he shouted. He ran out of his room. 'Where are you? Are you OK?'



Josh's grandmother was still in bed. He helped her and together they went out of the house. His mum was already in the street.



The house next to theirs - No.65 - wasn't there! Well, it was still there... but it wasn't a house now. There was just a front wall and a lot of bricks. Josh and his family waited and watched. The people from the other houses in the street were there too. Suddenly the front wall came down. There were more bricks and dust in the street. Everyone shouted. There was a cold wind on Josh's face. It blew out of the bricks.



'What was that?' asked Josh. But no one answered. Josh arrived at school at 8.45. He met his girlfriend Jaz in the classroom and told her about No.65.



'No! I don't believe it!' she said. 'Was anyone in the house?'



'No. They're on holiday in Egypt. They didn't turn off the gas in the kitchen, so there was a lot of gas in the house. Then something turned on... a light or something... and BOOM! The police think...'



But Josh didn't finish. There was a face... a girl... next to the door. Suddenly he was cold.



'Who...?' he whispered. Everything was quiet. There was only her face. She was older than him and pretty. But she wasn't happy.



He looked at Jaz. Then he looked across the room again. But where was the girl? She wasn't there.



Something touched his arm.



'What?!' He turned quickly.



'What's up, Josh?' asked Jaz. 'What are you looking at?'



'There was a girl... near the door,' he said. 'Who was she?'



'What girl?' asked Jaz. Josh didn't answer. 'I didn't see anyone. Are you feeling OK?'



'Yeah. I'm cool,' he said. He tried to forget about that face.





CHAPTER TWO



Tilly Turner



Jaz came to Josh's house that evening.



'There's a lot of dust!' she said.



'The gas people came,' said Josh's mum. 'They cleaned the house, but it's still dirty.'



'Well, we're luckier than the people at No.65,' said Gran.



Josh ran down from his room. 'Hi,' he called to Jaz.



Then he saw her. 'Hey! You look... fantastic,' he said and smiled. 'Bye, Mum. Bye, Gran,' he called.



'Be home before 11,' shouted his mum.



They stopped at No.65. Jaz wanted to see it.



They looked at the sad, dark place. A wind started to blow.



'Let's go to the club,' Josh said quickly. 'I don't like it here.'



Together they ran down the road.



'What do you want to drink?' Josh asked Jaz at the Waterlow Club.



'Just water for me, please,' said Jaz. 'Oh, look! There's Em. I must talk to her.'



'OK,' said Josh. He ordered the drinks. There was a DJ tonight - someone from their school - and there were a lot of people in the club. Josh waited for the drinks. His friend Flynn was there. They talked about football. And then, across the room, he saw that face again.



'Hey, Flynn. Who's that girl?'



'What girl?'



'Look! She's standing next to Jaz. She's got long brown hair and she's wearing a blue shirt and a white skirt. Her clothes are funny... I don't know, from the 1950s or something. She's looking at us.'



'I can't see anyone,' Flynn laughed. 'Did a brick from No.65 fall on your head this morning? Something isn't right...'



'She is there! It's that girl from school. I saw her this morning. Who is she?' He looked at Flynn. But Flynn just laughed again.



They gave Jaz her drink and then watched Outkast on MTV. Well, Jaz and Flynn watched.



'This music is fantastic,' Jaz said to Josh. 'I'm going to buy the new Outkast CD tomorrow. Do you want to come and listen to it at my house?' But Josh didn't answer. 'Are you listening to me? What are you looking at?' She was angry. 'What's up with you today?'



'It's that girl... from this morning. What's she doing here?' said Josh.



'What girl?!' shouted Jaz.



'Look - there. She's standing next to the door.'



'THERE'S NO ONE THERE, JOSH!' Jaz walked away angrily.



Josh didn't move. 'Flynn can't see her. Jaz can't see her. How can I see her?' he thought. He was frightened.



The girl was still there. She looked at him and then she walked out of the club. He didn't want to go with her; he wanted to stay at the club. But he followed her anyway.



She waited for him in the street, near the club door. She didn't have a coat.



'Are you cold?' Josh asked. He was cold, too, very cold, but he gave her his jacket. 'Let's go. I'm going to walk home with you,' he said. 'Where do you live?'



She didn't answer. She turned and walked across the road. Josh followed.



'I don't know your name,' said Josh.



'Tilly. Tilly Turner.' Did she speak? Or did the wind whisper the words?



She stopped at the cemetery.



'We can't go in there,' Josh said. 'They close the gate at night.'



She pointed at the gate and, very slowly, it opened.





CHAPTER THREE



The Cemetery at Night



Tilly went into the cemetery and waited. Josh didn't want to go through the gate. 'But I can't leave Tilly,' he thought. Then he said loudly, 'I'm going first.'



Tilly pointed to a small path.



'I often come in here,' said Josh. 'But not at night. It's different in the dark...'



It started to rain. They walked next to the graves. Suddenly, something ran across Josh's foot.



'What was that?'



Something touched his face.



'YEUCH! That's wet!'



He turned to Tilly. She was behind him.



'You don't say much. What's up?' he said. He laughed, but he was frightened. Why didn't she talk to him?



Tilly pointed to a little path on the right. Wet trees touched their faces. It was very dark. Josh stopped and listened. There were whispers. Who was it? Was it the dead people?



The path stopped. 'Where now?' Josh asked.



Tilly pointed through the trees.



'Why are we going this way?' But Tilly just looked at him with her sad green eyes.



They started to walk again. 'We can't go through here,' Josh said. 'There are too many trees.' He put his arms in front of his face. 'I can't see,' he called.



Suddenly his foot touched something hard.



'OW!' he shouted. There was a gravestone at his feet.



'Are you OK?' he called to Tilly. But she didn't answer. She wasn't there.



He went back but he didn't find her. Where was she?



'Tilly! Tilly!' he called, louder and louder. 'WHERE ARE YOU?'



He ran. 'I can't see the path!' Josh thought. He ran into a gravestone and cut his nose. 'YEOW!' he shouted.



Then he found a path. But where was Tilly? He called her name, again and again.



'I'm never going to find the gate,' he thought.



He walked for a long time in the dark and the rain. 'They're going to find my dead body in here in the morning.' He was very wet now, and his T-shirt and jeans were very dirty. But then he saw it. The gate!



He ran. But the gate started to close.



'NOOOOO!' he shouted.



He ran faster. He ran through the gate and - BANG! - it closed just behind him.





CHAPTER FOUR



'I Don't Believe in Ghosts!'



The next day was Saturday - no school. Josh got up late. 'What's wrong with me?' he thought. 'Why did I leave a girl in a cemetery... alone... in the dark?



He dressed and had some coffee. He didn't want any breakfast. 'I must find her,' he thought.



The cemetery was open. It was a nice day and there were a lot of people there. They wanted to see the famous gravestones. But Josh thought about the night before.



'I didn't want to follow Tilly. Why did I go with her? Is she a...? No! Of course she isn't a ghost. I don't believe in ghosts.'



He walked faster. 'But only I can see her,' he thought. 'Jaz and Flynn can't see her.' He was cold... cold and frightened.



He looked for the path from the night before. He walked from one end of the cemetery to the other, but he didn't find it. 'OK. I'm going home,' he decided.



Suddenly he saw something through the trees. It was red. What was it? He followed the path and then he found it. His jacket! His red jacket! It was on a gravestone.



He was happier now. 'Tilly put it there for me,' he thought. 'She was OK last night. She knew the way out of the cemetery.' He took the jacket and turned back. But a cold wind blew across his face. 'Look! Look!' the wind whispered in his ear. He looked at the gravestone. 'Edward Turner. 1926-1973.'



'Turner?' he said quietly. 'Tilly Turner? Edward Turner?'



Josh went home. His grandmother was in the kitchen.



'Your face is white, Josh! Is something wrong?'



He told her everything. 'I was very frightened, Gran.'



'Well!' she said. She gave him some tea. 'I can understand some of it. I was at school with Tilly. We were friends. We finished school at 14 and went out to work. And then she met a man - Edward Turner. Ed, she called him. No one liked him, but she didn't listen to us. She married him and they moved to the house next to ours - No.65. Ed was older than Tilly, maybe 30. She was only 16. I saw her most days after work. Then I didn't see her for three or four weeks. She didn't answer the door. One day my mum said, "You know that Tilly Turner? You're not going to see her again. She met a younger man and left. There's only Ed at No.65 now."



"Good," I thought. "Tilly's going to be happier without her husband."'



Josh said nothing at first. 'She is a ghost, then,' he said after some minutes. He didn't like the idea. 'But why can I see her? What does she want from me?'



'Some people can see ghosts,' said his grandmother. 'Only a few people. You're very special, Josh.'



Josh got up from the table. He didn't want to hear this. 'I'm not special,' he shouted. 'AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS!'



He went out in the afternoon. 'I must talk to Jaz,' he thought. 'She's going to be very angry with me.' He phoned her mobile but she didn't answer. He stopped at No.65 and looked at the bricks. And then he saw... what was it?... a door?... something under the bricks. 'I didn't see that last time,' he thought. A cold wind started to blow. Old cans and chocolate papers danced down the street. He put his hands over his ears.



'No! NO!' he shouted. 'I CAN'T HELP YOU!'



He turned and ran.





CHAPTER FIVE



The Room Under the House



Josh closed his eyes. He ran down the street... and into Jaz.



He was right. She was very angry.



'Josh! I do NOT want to talk to you.' Josh didn't answer. 'Where did you go last night? Why did you go without me? Never -' She stopped.



Josh's face was white. She looked at his frightened eyes and touched him. He was cold, very cold.



'Josh, what's up?' She took his arm. 'Josh?' She was sorry now. 'Let's go and have a coffee.'



They walked slowly to a cafe. They sat at a table near the window and talked for hours.



'It can't be true,' Jaz said. But when she looked at Josh's face... into his eyes... she knew. It was true.



'What does Tilly want?' asked Josh.



'Let's go and look at No.65,' said Jaz. 'Maybe the answer's there.'



It was evening now. They went to Josh's house first and found a torch. Then they climbed over the fence to No.65. The wind started again.



They moved some bricks away and found a door there. Josh pulled the door.



'I can't open it,' he said.



'Let's try together,' said Jaz. They pulled hard... harder. Suddenly it opened - BANG! They pointed the torch through the door. There was a room - a room under the house.



Josh went down first. He took Jaz's hand.



'Are you OK?' he asked her.



'Yeah, yeah. I'm cool,' she said. But she didn't feel cool. She was frightened.



There was no sound. The room was wet and cold and dirty. Josh pointed into the dark with his torch. Suddenly they saw a long box near the wall.



'AAAHHH! Wh-What's that?' asked Jaz. 'I can't do this, Josh. Let's go.'



'No. Wait a minute,' he said.



'But I'm frightened.'



'Me too. Just a minute.' Josh went nearer. 'Take the torch. Point it at the box.' He pulled the top of the box and it came away in his hands. There was lots of dust.



'WHOAH!' shouted Jaz and Josh. They looked through the dust. Two black eyes looked back at them.



'A skeleton!' whispered Jaz. 'There's a skeleton in the box!'



'And look,' said Josh. 'It's wearing a blue shirt and a white skirt...'



Suddenly, some bricks moved behind them. They turned and looked at the door.



'It's closing,' shouted Josh. Jaz got out first and pulled Josh behind her. But the door came down on his head.



'OW!' he cried. Someone laughed.



'Who was that?' asked Josh from behind the door.



'Are you OK?' called Jaz. She pulled on the door and opened it again.



'No, I'm not OK. I don't like this place,' he said.



They quickly ran to the fence. A cold wind blew around them. 'It's a ghost,' Josh said. 'I can feel it. Tilly? Tilly? Is that you?'



But it wasn't Tilly. He knew that. This was a bad ghost. 'Quickly, Jaz. Let's go - NOW.'



They climbed over the fence and into the street. The wind was louder now. They ran to No.63. The wind followed. Something was there, just behind them. Josh pulled Jaz into the house with him. He closed the door, hard, and took Jaz's hand. They didn't make a sound. They listened and waited. Slowly, very slowly, the sound of the wind went away. They were safe.





CHAPTER SIX



The Ghost Can Leave



In the morning, Josh phoned the police. They came and put a bigger fence around No.65. At 3 o'clock the skeleton came out. There were lots of TV and newspaper people in the street. They talked to Josh's grandmother. They wanted to talk to Josh and Jaz, but Josh and Jaz didn't come out.



A policewoman came to No.63 in the afternoon.



'We found her,' she said. 'You were right, Josh - it is Tilly Turner. And we found something interesting next to her skeleton.' She gave him a photo.



'What is it?' asked Jaz.



'It's a penknife,' answered Josh. 'Look.'



'It's got letters on it - E T,' said Jaz.



'E T? Edward Turner!' shouted Josh's grandmother. 'I knew it! Tilly didn't meet a younger man - Ed killed her!' She put her hands over her face.



Josh took her hand. 'It's OK, Gran. It was a long time ago. Tilly's happy now. She wanted to tell us about Ed. Now we know about him, so her ghost can leave No.65.'



'Her ghost?' said the policewoman.



Josh looked at Gran. He smiled. She smiled too.



A week after this, Josh, Jaz and their families were in Highgate Cemetery next to Tilly's family grave. Tilly's brothers were there. They were old now and very sad about Tilly. The TV and newspaper people were there too.



Tilly's skeleton went into the family grave, with her father and mother. Josh remembered that night in the cemetery. He was happier now, because it wasn't dark. Then he saw something blue behind the TV cameras. Was it...? Yes, it was Tilly's shirt! Tilly was there. But not the old, sad Tilly. She wasn't sad now - she was happy. She smiled at him. He took Jaz's hand and then looked for Tilly again. But Tilly wasn't there. 'Good. She's OK now. Maybe I'm going to be OK too,' he thought.



It was a hot day. Josh and Jaz walked to the gate. The newspaper men followed them.



'Just one more picture,' they called. Josh and Jaz smiled for the cameras.



Then Josh saw a face, near the gate. The face looked at him. It was a boy - a young boy. Suddenly everything was quiet. Josh didn't hear the people or the cameras. And he was very cold.



'What's up, Josh?' asked Jaz. 'What are you looking at now?!'

Urban Myths



THE QUEENSWAY GHOST



One of the biggest roads into the city of Liverpool in England is Queensway. About 20 years ago, a man on a motorbike was on this road. He saw a hitch-hiker by the road. The hitch-hiker was a boy, about 18 years old. The man stopped for him. There were a lot of cars and they went slowly down the road. The man and the boy had a conversation.



'Where do you live?' asked the man.



'Not far from here. Next to the Black Cat pub in Southport,' said the boy.



After a few minutes, the man turned to the boy again. But he wasn't there! Where was he? The man looked and looked but he didn't find him.



A few days after this, the man was in Southport. He went to the boy's house. A woman answered the door. He told her about the boy.



'That's my son,' she said. 'Five years ago, he was on his motorbike on Queensway. A car drove into him and he died.'





THE HOOK



In London in the 1960s, Gill had a boyfriend. His name was Tom. In the 1960s there weren't many interesting places for teenagers in the evenings. One Friday night, Tom and Gill drove to Crystal Palace Park. It was dark and quiet. Tom turned on the radio. Then he put his arm around Gill.



'This is a police message,' said the radio. 'Police in Crystal Palace are looking for a man with a hook in place of his right arm. Do not go near him. It isn't safe.'



'Tom! We must leave here,' said Gill.



'He's not going to come into the park,' said Tom. 'Everything's OK.' He put his other arm around Gill.



'Please, Tom! Let's go,' said Gill.



Tom was angry. He didn't want to go. He started the car and drove quickly back to Gill's house. He got out and walked around the car. He wanted to open Gill's car door for her.



'AAAHHHH!!!' he shouted.



Gill got out of the car.



There, on her car door, was... a hook





Creepy Castles



Let's hear from the ghosts...



They call me the Blue Boy I cry every night at 12 o'clock. People hear me and feel cold.



They found my skeleton in 1920 in the wall of the castle. My father hated me. He put me in the wall. He didn't give me any food or water. My mother called my name day and night. I shouted to her, but she didn't hear me. After three weeks, I died... at 12 o'clock. That was in 1665. Sometimes I come out of the wall and stand by the bed. My clothes are blue.'



'My name's Ella and I'm 13 years old. I love dancing. I dance all day and all night. One night, about 300 years ago, I danced at the top of the tallest tower in the castle. A wind started suddenly and blew me off the tower. I died. Lots of people come to see the castle now. Sometimes I ask them, 'Do you want to dance with me?' But no one says yes. It makes me sad.'



I'm Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1567 I married my third husband in this castle. But that night, some men came here. They wanted to kill me. I dressed in boy's clothes and left the castle. Luckily, no one saw me. But in 1587 my cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England, wanted me dead. Her men cut off my head. I still haunt a lot of Scottish castles. At Borthwick I always wear boy's clothes.





Cornwall: Land of Legend



Cornwall is famous for its empty country and sea storms - and for its stories and ghosts.





King Arthur



King Arthur was a British king around 500 years after Jesus Christ. There are a lot of books and films about him, but no one knows the true story. In most of the stories, Arthur came from Cornwall. Tintagel Castle was his first home. The ghost of Merlin the Magician still lives near the castle.





The spirits of the mine



Long ago, spirits lived and worked in the mines of Cornwall. Then people found the mines and started to work in them. But the spirit miners didn't go away.



Tom Trevorrow was a miner at St Just. He was never happy. One day he heard the spirit miners.



'Go away,' he shouted at them. 'Leave us some cake, Tom Trevorrow,' they answered, 'or bad things are going to happen to you.'



Tom had some cake in his lunch bag. But Tom wasn't very clever. He decided to eat it all. He didn't leave any cake for the spirits.



The next day, the walls of his mine came down. Then water came into the mine. It wasn't possible to work there. Tom closed his mine and bought some fields.





Bolster the giant



Once Cornwall was the home of giants. They had a big castle at Trecobben. They took people to their castle and had them for dinner.



One giant's name was Bolster. Bolster loved Agnes and he followed her all the time. She was angry with him. 'You have a wife and I do not love you. Do not speak to me again.' But he didn't listen.



'Right,' she said. 'I'm going to test your love for me. Put your blood into this hole. I want to see blood all the way to the top.' The giant cut his arm. His blood ran into the hole. 'This isn't going to take long,' he thought. But the hole stayed empty. All the giant's blood ran into the hole and he died. Why did the hole stay empty? Because it went down into the sea below. You can still see the hole today at Chapel Forth. Everything around the hole is red from the giant's blood.





Black Shuck: Dog of the Dead



It's cold and dark. It's raining. The wind is blowing. You're walking home on a quiet path.



Suddenly you hear feet behind you. Not the feet of a man - these are animal feet. The feet are louder now. You look around and see something black. It's moving.



It's coming nearer and nearer. It's a big black dog - Black Shuck! Quick! Close your eyes! Don't look into Black Shuck's red eyes, or someone in your family is going to die before the end of the year!



Arthur Conan Doyle got the idea for his famous Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles, from Black Shuck. The stories about Black Shuck come from East Anglia in England. The land here is flat, wet and empty. People often see Black Shuck. Sometimes Black Shuck has no head or only one big eye.





Here's one story about Black Shuck.



Bungay is a small town in East Anglia. One Sunday morning in 1577, the people of Bungay were in church. There was a big storm and the sky was dark. Suddenly Black Shuck ran through the church.



There were two people at the front of the church. The dog ran between them and they were dead. The dog then ran into a third man. Suddenly a fire started around him. He died too. At the same minute, the same thing happened in Blythburgh, 10 kilometres away. A black dog ran into the church. It killed three people and ran away. Parts of the church door were black from fire. The door is still like that today.

В конце ноября, в оттепель, часов в девять утра, поезд Петербургско-Варшавской железной дороги на всех парах подходил к Петербургу. Было так сыро и туманно, что насилу рассвело; в десяти шагах, вправо и влево от дороги, трудно было разглядеть хоть что-нибудь из окон вагона. Из пассажиров были и возвращавшиеся из-за границы; но более были наполнены отделения для третьего класса, и всё людом мелким и деловым, не из очень далека. Все, как водится, устали, у всех отяжелели за ночь глаза, все назяблись, все лица были бледно-желтые, под цвет тумана.
В одном из вагонов третьего класса, с рассвета, очутились друг против друга, у самого окна, два пассажира — оба люди молодые, оба почти налегке, оба не щегольски одетые, оба с довольно замечательными физиономиями и оба пожелавшие, наконец, войти друг с другом в разговор. Если б они оба знали один про другого, чем они особенно в эту минуту замечательны, то, конечно, подивились бы, что случай так странно посадил их друг против друга в третьеклассном вагоне петербургско-варшавского поезда. Один из них был небольшого роста, лет двадцати семи, курчавый и почти черноволосый, с серыми маленькими, но огненными глазами. Нос его был широк и сплюснут, лицо скулистое; тонкие губы беспрерывно складывались в какую-то наглую, насмешливую и даже злую улыбку; но лоб его был высок и хорошо сформирован и скрашивал неблагородно развитую нижнюю часть лица. Особенно приметна была в этом лице его мертвая бледность, придававшая всей физиономии молодого человека изможденный вид, несмотря на довольно крепкое сложение, и вместе с тем что-то страстное, до страдания, не гармонировавшее с нахальною и грубою улыбкой и с резким, самодовольным его взглядом. Он был тепло одет, в широкий мерлушечий черный крытый тулуп, и за ночь не зяб, тогда как сосед его принужден был вынести на своей издрогшей спине всю сладость сырой ноябрьской русской ночи, к которой, очевидно, был не приготовлен. На нем был довольно широкий и толстый плащ без рукавов и с огромным капюшоном, точь-в-точь как употребляют часто дорожные, по зимам, где-нибудь далеко за границей, в Швейцарии или, например, в Северной Италии, не рассчитывая, конечно, при этом и на такие концы по дороге, как от Эйдткунена до Петербурга. Но что годилось и вполне удовлетворяло в Италии, то оказалось не совсем пригодным в России. Обладатель плаща с капюшоном был молодой человек, тоже лет двадцати шести или двадцати семи, роста немного повыше среднего, очень белокур, густоволос, со впалыми щеками и с легонькою, востренькою, почти совершенно белою бородкой. Глаза его были большие, голубые и пристальные; во взгляде их было что-то тихое, но тяжелое, что-то полное того странного выражения, по которому некоторые угадывают с первого взгляда в субъекте падучую болезнь. Лицо молодого человека было, впрочем, приятное, тонкое и сухое, но бесцветное, а теперь даже досиня иззябшее. В руках его болтался тощий узелок из старого, полинялого фуляра, заключавший, кажется, всё его дорожное достояние. На ногах его были толстоподошвенные башмаки с штиблетами, — всё не по-русски. Черноволосый сосед в крытом тулупе всё это разглядел, частию от нечего делать, и наконец спросил с тою неделикатною усмешкой, в которой так бесцеремонно и небрежно выражается иногда людское удовольствие при неудачах ближнего:
— Зябко?
И повел плечами.
— Очень, — ответил сосед с чрезвычайною готовностью, — и, заметьте, это еще оттепель. Что ж, если бы мороз? Я даже не думал, что у нас так холодно. Отвык.
— Из-за границы, что ль?
— Да, из Швейцарии.
— Фью! Эк ведь вас!..
Черноволосый присвистнул и захохотал.
Завязался разговор. Готовность белокурого молодого человека в швейцарском плаще отвечать на все вопросы своего черномазого соседа была удивительная и без всякого подозрения совершенной небрежности, неуместности и праздности иных вопросов. Отвечая, он объявил, между прочим, что действительно долго не был в России, с лишком четыре года, что отправлен был за границу по болезни, по какой-то странной нервной болезни, вроде падучей или виттовой пляски, каких-то дрожаний и судорог. Слушая его, черномазый несколько раз усмехался; особенно засмеялся он, когда на вопрос: «Что же, вылечили?» — белокурый отвечал, что «нет, не вылечили».
— Хе! Денег что, должно быть, даром переплатили, а мы-то им здесь верим, — язвительно заметил черномазый.
— Истинная правда! — ввязался в разговор один сидевший рядом и дурно одетый господин, нечто вроде закорузлого в подьячестве чиновника, лет сорока, сильного сложения, с красным носом и угреватым лицом, — истинная правда-с, только все русские силы даром к себе переводят!
— О, как вы в моем случае ошибаетесь, — подхватил швейцарский пациент тихим и примиряющим голосом, — конечно, я спорить не могу, потому что всего не знаю, но мой доктор мне из своих последних еще на дорогу сюда дал да два почти года там на свой счет содержал.
— Что ж, некому платить, что ли, было? — спросил черномазый.
— Да, господин Павлищев, который меня там содержал, два года назад помер; я писал потом сюда генеральше Епанчиной, моей дальней родственнице, но ответа не получил. Так с тем и приехал.
— Куда же приехали-то?
— То есть где остановлюсь?.. Да не знаю еще, право... так...
— Не решились еще?
И оба слушателя снова захохотали.
— И небось в этом узелке вся ваша суть заключается? — спросил черномазый.
— Об заклад готов биться, что так, — подхватил с чрезвычайно довольным видом красноносый чиновник, — и что дальнейшей поклажи в багажных вагонах не имеется, хотя бедность и не порок, чего опять-таки нельзя не заметить.
Оказалось, что и это было так: белокурый молодой человек тотчас же и с необыкновенною поспешностью в этом признался.
— Узелок ваш все-таки имеет некоторое значение, — продолжал чиновник, когда нахохотались досыта (замечательно, что и сам обладатель узелка начал наконец смеяться, глядя на них, что увеличило их веселость), — и хотя можно побиться, что в нем не заключается золотых заграничных свертков с наполеондорами и фридрихсдорами, ниже с голландскими арапчиками, о чем можно еще заключить хотя бы только по штиблетам, облекающим иностранные башмаки ваши, но... если к вашему узелку прибавить в придачу такую будто бы родственницу, как, примерно, генеральша Епанчина, то и узелок примет некоторое иное значение, разумеется в том только случае, если генеральша Епанчина вам действительно родственница и вы не ошибаетесь, по рассеянности... что очень и очень свойственно человеку, ну хоть... от излишка воображения.
— О, вы угадали опять, — подхватил белокурый молодой человек, — ведь действительно почти ошибаюсь, то есть почти что не родственница; до того даже, что я, право, нисколько и не удивился тогда, что мне туда не ответили. Я так и ждал.
— Даром деньги на франкировку письма истратили. Гм... по крайней мере простодушны и искренны, а сие похвально! Гм... генерала же Епанчина знаем-с, собственно, потому, что человек общеизвестный; да и покойного господина Павлищева, который вас в Швейцарии содержал, тоже знавали-с, если только это был Николай Андреевич Павлищев, потому что их два двоюродные брата. Другой доселе в Крыму, а Николай Андреевич, покойник, был человек почтенный, и при связях, и четыре тысячи душ в свое время имели-с...
— Точно так, его звали Николай Андреевич Павлищев, — и, ответив, молодой человек пристально и пытливо оглядел господина всезнайку.
Эти господа всезнайки встречаются иногда, даже довольно часто, в известном общественном слое. Они всё знают, вся беспокойная пытливость их ума и способности устремляются неудержимо в одну сторону, конечно за отсутствием более важных жизненных интересов и взглядов, как сказал бы современный мыслитель. Под словом «всё знают» нужно разуметь, впрочем, область довольно ограниченную: где служит такой-то, с кем он знаком, сколько у него состояния, где был губернатором, на ком женат, сколько взял за женой, кто ему двоюродным братом приходится, кто троюродным и т. д., и т. д., и всё в этом роде. Большею частию эти всезнайки ходят с ободранными локтями и получают по семнадцати рублей в месяц жалованья. Люди, о которых они знают всю подноготную, конечно, не придумали бы, какие интересы руководствуют ими, а между тем многие из них этим знанием, равняющимся целой науке, положительно утешены, достигают самоуважения и даже высшего духовного довольства. Да и наука соблазнительная. Я видал ученых, литераторов, поэтов, политических деятелей, обретавших и обретших в этой же науке свои высшие примирения и цели, даже положительно только этим сделавших карьеру. В продолжение всего этого разговора черномазый молодой человек зевал, смотрел без цели в окно и с нетерпением ждал конца путешествия. Он был как-то рассеян, что-то очень рассеян, чуть ли не встревожен, даже становился как-то странен: иной раз слушал и не слушал, глядел и не глядел, смеялся и подчас сам не знал и не понимал, чему смеялся.
— А позвольте, с кем имею честь... — обратился вдруг угреватый господин к белокурому молодому человеку с узелком.
— Князь Лев Николаевич Мышкин, — отвечал тот с полною и немедленною готовностью.
— Князь Мышкин? Лев Николаевич? Не знаю-с. Так что даже и не слыхивал-с, — отвечал в раздумье чиновник, — то есть я не об имени, имя историческое, в Карамзина «Истории» найти можно и должно, я об лице-с, да и князей Мышкиных уж что-то нигде не встречается, даже и слух затих-с.
— О, еще бы! — тотчас же ответил князь, — князей Мышкиных теперь и совсем нет, кроме меня; мне кажется, я последний. А что касается до отцов и дедов, то они у нас и однодворцами бывали. Отец мой был, впрочем, армии подпоручик, из юнкеров. Да вот не знаю, каким образом и генеральша Епанчина очутилась тоже из княжон Мышкиных, тоже последняя в своем роде...
— Хе-хе-хе! Последняя в своем роде! Хе-хе! Как это вы оборотили, — захихикал чиновник.
Усмехнулся тоже и черномазый. Белокурый несколько удивился, что ему удалось сказать, довольно, впрочем, плохой, каламбур.
— А представьте, я совсем не думая сказал, — пояснил он наконец в удивлении.
— Да уж понятно-с, понятно-с, — весело поддакнул чиновник.
— А что вы, князь, и наукам там обучались, у профессора-то? — спросил вдруг черномазый.
— Да... учился...
— А я вот ничему никогда не обучался.
— Да ведь и я так, кой-чему только, — прибавил князь, чуть не в извинение. — Меня по болезни не находили возможным систематически учить.
— Рогожиных знаете? — быстро спросил черномазый.
— Нет, не знаю, совсем. Я ведь в России очень мало кого знаю. Это вы-то Рогожин?
— Да, я, Рогожин, Парфен.
— Парфен? Да уж это не тех ли самых Рогожиных... — начал было с усиленною важностью чиновник.
— Да, тех, тех самых, — быстро и с невежливым нетерпением перебил его черномазый, который вовсе, впрочем, и не обращался ни разу к угреватому чиновнику, а с самого начала говорил только одному князю.
— Да... как же это? — удивился до столбняка и чуть не выпучил глаза чиновник, у которого всё лицо тотчас же стало складываться во что-то благоговейное, и подобострастное, даже испуганное, — это того самого Семена Парфеновича Рогожина, потомственного почетного гражданина, что с месяц назад тому помре и два с половиной миллиона капиталу оставил?
— А ты откуда узнал, что он два с половиной миллиона чистого капиталу оставил? — перебил черномазый, не удостоивая и в этот раз взглянуть на чиновника. — Ишь ведь! (мигнул он на него князю) и что только им от этого толку, что они прихвостнями тотчас же лезут? А это правда, что вот родитель мой помер, а я из Пскова через месяц чуть не без сапог домой еду. Ни брат, подлец, ни мать ни денег, ни уведомления — ничего не прислали! Как собаке! В горячке в Пскове весь месяц пролежал.
— А теперь миллиончик с лишком разом получить приходится, и это по крайней мере, о господи! — всплеснул руками чиновник.
— Ну чего ему, скажите, пожалуйста! — раздражительно и злобно кивнул на него опять Рогожин, — ведь я тебе ни копейки не дам, хоть ты тут вверх ногами предо мной ходи.
— И буду, и буду ходить.
— Вишь! Да ведь не дам, не дам, хошь целую неделю пляши!
— И не давай! Так мне и надо; не давай! А я буду плясать. Жену, детей малых брошу, а пред тобой буду плясать. Польсти, польсти!
— Тьфу тебя! — сплюнул черномазый. — Пять недель назад я вот, как и вы, — обратился он к князю, — с одним узелком от родителя во Псков убег, к тетке; да в горячке там и слег, а он без меня и помре. Кондрашка пришиб. Вечная память покойнику, а чуть меня тогда до смерти не убил! Верите ли, князь, вот ей-богу! Не убеги я тогда, как раз бы убил.
— Вы его чем-нибудь рассердили? — отозвался князь с некоторым особенным любопытством рассматривая миллионера в тулупе. Но хотя и могло быть нечто достопримечательное собственно в миллионе и в получении наследства, князя удивило и заинтересовало и еще что-то другое; да и Рогожин сам почему-то особенно охотно взял князя в свои собеседники, хотя в собеседничестве нуждался, казалось, более механически, чем нравственно; как-то более от рассеянности, чем от простосердечия; от тревоги, от волнения, чтобы только глядеть на кого-нибудь и о чем-нибудь языком колотить. Казалось, что он до сих пор в горячке, и уж по крайней мере в лихорадке. Что же касается до чиновника, так тот так и повис над Рогожиным, дыхнуть не смел, ловил и взвешивал каждое слово, точно бриллианта искал.
— Рассердился-то он рассердился, да, может, и стоило, — отвечал Рогожин, — но меня пуще всего брат доехал. Про матушку нечего сказать, женщина старая, Четьи-Минеи читает, со старухами сидит, и что Сенька-брат порешит, так тому и быть. А он что же мне знать-то в свое время не дал? Понимаем-с! Оно правда, я тогда без памяти был. Тоже, говорят, телеграмма была пущена. Да телеграмма-то к тетке и приди. А она там тридцатый год вдовствует и всё с юродивыми сидит с утра до ночи. Монашенка не монашенка, а еще пуще того. Телеграммы-то она испужалась да, не распечатывая, в часть и представила, так она там и залегла до сих пор. Только Конев, Василий Васильич, выручил, всё отписал. С покрова парчового на гробе родителя, ночью, брат кисти литые, золотые, обрезал: «Они, дескать, эвона каких денег стоят». Да ведь он за это одно в Сибирь пойти может, если я захочу, потому оно есть святотатство. Эй ты, пугало гороховое! — обратился он к чиновнику. — Как по закону: святотатство?
— Святотатство! Святотатство! — тотчас же поддакнул чиновник.
— За это в Сибирь?
— В Сибирь, в Сибирь! Тотчас в Сибирь!
— Они всё думают, что я еще болен, — продолжал Рогожин князю, — а я, ни слова не говоря, потихоньку, еще больной, сел в вагон да и еду: отворяй ворота, братец Семен Семеныч! Он родителю покойному на меня наговаривал, я знаю. А что я действительно чрез Настасью Филипповну тогда родителя раздражил, так это правда. Тут уж я один. Попутал грех.
— Чрез Настасью Филипповну? — подобострастно промолвил чиновник, как бы что-то соображая.
— Да ведь не знаешь! — крикнул на него в нетерпении Рогожин.
— Ан и знаю! — победоносно отвечал чиновник.
— Эвона! Да мало ль Настасий Филипповн! И какая ты наглая, я тебе скажу, тварь! Ну, вот так и знал, что какая-нибудь вот этакая тварь так тотчас же и повиснет! — продолжал он князю.
— Ан, может, и знаю-с! — тормошился чиновник. — Лебедев знает! Вы, ваша светлость, меня укорять изволите, а что коли я докажу? Ан та самая Настасья Филипповна и есть, чрез которую ваш родитель вам внушить пожелал калиновым посохом, а Настасья Филипповна есть Барашкова, так сказать даже знатная барыня, и тоже в своем роде княжна, а знается с некоим Тоцким, с Афанасием Ивановичем, с одним исключительно, помещиком и раскапиталистом, членом компаний и обществ, и большую дружбу на этот счет с генералом Епанчиным ведущие...
— Эге, да ты вот что! — действительно удивился наконец Рогожин. — Тьфу, черт, да ведь он и впрямь знает.
— Всё знает! Лебедев всё знает! Я, ваша светлость, и с Лихачевым Алексашкой два месяца ездил, и тоже после смерти родителя, и все, то есть все углы и проулки знаю, и без Лебедева, дошло до того, что ни шагу. Ныне он в долговом отделении присутствует, а тогда и Арманс, и Коралию, и княгиню Пацкую, и Настасью Филипповну имел случай узнать, да и много чего имел случай узнать.
— Настасью Филипповну? А разве она с Лихачевым... — злобно посмотрел на него Рогожин, даже губы его побледнели и задрожали.
— Н-ничего! Н-н-ничего! Как есть ничего! — спохватился и заторопился поскорее чиновник, — н-никакими то есть деньгами Лихачев доехать не мог! Нет, это не то что Арманс. Тут один Тоцкий. Да вечером в Большом али во Французском театре в своей собственной ложе сидит. Офицеры там мало ли что промеж себя говорят, а и те ничего не могут доказать: «вот, дескать, это есть та самая Настасья Филипповна», да и только; а насчет дальнейшего — ничего! Потому что и нет ничего.
— Это вот всё так и есть, — мрачно и насупившись подтвердил Рогожин, — тоже мне и Залёжев тогда говорил. Я тогда, князь, в третьегодняшней отцовской бекеше через Невский перебегал, а она из магазина выходит, в карету садится. Так меня тут и прожгло. Встречаю Залёжева, тот не мне чета, ходит как приказчик от парикмахера, и лорнет в глазу, а мы у родителя в смазных сапогах да на постных щах отличались. Это, говорит, не тебе чета, это, говорит, княгиня, а зовут ее Настасьей Филипповной, фамилией Барашкова, и живет с Тоцким, а Тоцкий от нее как отвязаться теперь не знает, потому совсем то есть лет достиг настоящих, пятидесяти пяти, и жениться на первейшей раскрасавице во всем Петербурге хочет. Тут он мне и внушил, что сегодня же можешь Настасью Филипповну в Большом театре видеть, в балете, в ложе своей, в бенуаре, будет сидеть. У нас, у родителя, попробуй-ка в балет сходить, — одна расправа, убьет! Я, однако же, на час втихомолку сбегал и Настасью Филипповну опять видел; всю ту ночь не спал. Наутро покойник дает мне два пятипроцентные билета, по пяти тысяч каждый, сходи, дескать, да продай, да семь тысяч пятьсот к Андреевым на контору снеси, уплати, а остальную сдачу с десяти тысяч, не заходя никуда, мне представь; буду тебя дожидаться. Билеты-то я продал, деньги взял, а к Андреевым в контору не заходил, а пошел, никуда не глядя, в английский магазин да на все пару подвесок и выбрал, по одному бриллиантику в каждой, этак почти как по ореху будут, четыреста рублей должен остался, имя сказал, поверили. С подвесками я к Залёжеву: так и так, идем, брат, к Настасье Филипповне. Отправились. Что у меня тогда под ногами, что предо мною, что по бокам — ничего я этого не знаю и не помню. Прямо к ней в залу вошли, сама вышла к нам. Я то есть тогда не сказался, что это я самый и есть; а «от Парфена, дескать, Рогожина, — говорит Залёжев, — вам в память встречи вчерашнего дня; соблаговолите принять». Раскрыла, взглянула, усмехнулась: «Благодарите, говорит, вашего друга господина Рогожина за его любезное внимание», — откланялась и ушла. Ну, вот зачем я тут не помер тогда же! Да если и пошел, так потому, что думал: «Всё равно, живой не вернусь!» А обиднее всего мне то показалось, что этот бестия Залёжев всё на себя присвоил. Я и ростом мал, и одет как холуй, и стою, молчу, на нее глаза пялю, потому стыдно, а он по всей моде, в помаде и завитой, румяный, галстух клетчатый, — так и рассыпается, так и расшаркивается, и уж наверно она его тут вместо меня приняла! «Ну, говорю, как мы вышли, ты у меня теперь тут не смей и подумать, понимаешь!» Смеется: «А вот как-то ты теперь Семену Парфенычу отчет отдавать будешь?» Я, правда, хотел было тогда же в воду, домой не заходя, да думаю: «Ведь уж всё равно», — и как окаянный воротился домой.
— Эх! Ух! — кривился чиновник, и даже дрожь его пробирала, — а ведь покойник не то что за десять тысяч, а за десять целковых на тот свет сживывал, — кивнул он князю. Князь с любопытством рассматривал Рогожина; казалось, тот был еще бледнее в эту минуту.
— «Сживывал»! — переговорил Рогожин. — Ты что знаешь? Тотчас, — продолжал он князю, — про всё узнал, да и Залёжев каждому встречному пошел болтать. Взял меня родитель, и наверху запер, и целый час поучал. «Это я только, говорит, предуготовляю тебя, а вот я с тобой еще на ночь попрощаться зайду». Что ж ты думаешь? Поехал седой к Настасье Филипповне, земно ей кланялся, умолял и плакал; вынесла она ему наконец коробку, шваркнула: «Вот, говорит, тебе, старая борода, твои серьги, а они мне теперь в десять раз дороже ценой, коли из-под такой грозы их Парфен добывал. Кланяйся, говорит, и благодари Парфена Семеныча». Ну, а я этой порой, по матушкину благословению, у Сережки Протушина двадцать рублей достал да во Псков по машине и отправился, да приехал-то в лихорадке; меня там святцами зачитывать старухи принялись, а я пьян сижу, да пошел потом по кабакам на последние, да в бесчувствии всю ночь на улице и провалялся, ан к утру горячка, а тем временем за ночь еще собаки обгрызли. Насилу очнулся.
— Ну-с, ну-с, теперь запоет у нас Настасья Филипповна! — потирая руки, хихикал чиновник, — теперь, сударь, что подвески! Теперь мы такие подвески вознаградим...
— А то, что если ты хоть раз про Настасью Филипповну какое слово молвишь, то, вот тебе бог, тебя высеку, даром что ты с Лихачевым ездил, — вскрикнул Рогожин, крепко схватив его за руку.
— А коли высечешь, значит, и не отвергнешь! Секи! Высек, и тем самым запечатлел... А вот и приехали!
Действительно, въезжали в воксал. Хотя Рогожин и говорил, что он уехал тихонько, но его уже поджидали несколько человек. Они кричали и махали ему шапками.
— Ишь, и Залёжев тут! — пробормотал Рогожин, смотря на них с торжествующею и даже как бы злобною улыбкой, и вдруг оборотился к князю. — Князь, неизвестно мне, за что я тебя полюбил. Может, оттого, что в этакую минуту встретил, да вот ведь и его встретил (он указал на Лебедева), а ведь не полюбил же его. Приходи ко мне, князь. Мы эти штиблетишки-то с тебя поснимаем, одену тебя в кунью шубу в первейшую, фрак тебе сошью первейший, жилетку белую али какую хошь, денег полны карманы набью, и... поедем к Настасье Филипповне! Придешь али нет?
— Внимайте, князь Лев Николаевич! — внушительно и торжественно подхватил Лебедев. — Ой, не упускайте! Ой, не упускайте!..
Князь Мышкин привстал, вежливо протянул Рогожину руку и любезно сказал ему:
— С величайшим удовольствием приду и очень вас благодарю за то, что вы меня полюбили. Даже, может быть, сегодня же приду, если успею. Потому, я вам скажу откровенно, вы мне сами очень понравились, и особенно когда про подвески бриллиантовые рассказывали. Даже и прежде подвесок понравились, хотя у вас и сумрачное лицо. Благодарю вас тоже за обещанные мне платья и за шубу, потому мне действительно платье и шуба скоро понадобятся. Денег же у меня в настоящую минуту почти ни копейки нет.
— Деньги будут, к вечеру будут, приходи!
— Будут, будут, — подхватил чиновник, — к вечеру, до зари еще, будут!
— А до женского пола вы, князь, охотник большой? Сказывайте раньше!
— Я, н-н-нет! Я ведь... Вы, может быть, не знаете, я ведь по прирожденной болезни моей даже совсем женщин не знаю.
— Ну коли так, — воскликнул Рогожин, — совсем ты, князь, выходишь юродивый, и таких, как ты, бог любит!
— И таких господь бог любит, — подхватил чиновник.
— А ты ступай за мной, строка, — сказал Рогожин Лебедеву, и все вышли из вагона.
Лебедев кончил тем, что достиг своего. Скоро шумная ватага удалилась по направлению к Вознесенскому проспекту. Князю надо было повернуть к Литейной. Было сыро и мокро; князь расспросил прохожих, — до конца предстоявшего ему пути выходило версты три, и он решился взять извозчика.
